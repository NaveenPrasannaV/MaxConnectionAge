I have created a gRPC Java POC to reproduce the StatusException: UNAVAILABLE on the client when maxConnectionAge is set on the server. However I am not encountering the exception even after trying different scenarios such as reducing maxConnectionAgeGrace from 300 seconds to 10 seconds and using a request size of 4 MB for a 4 MB response. after these many attempts I am still unable to trigger the exception
